# Hello Readers
This is the source repository for my website.

I used Hugo to create my page, which is a static website generator.

Some tutorials I used to create the page are placed here:

- https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/

My site is based on the PaperModX theme:
https://github.com/reorx/hugo-PaperModX

This was fairly simple to create - can definitely be done before lunch!
