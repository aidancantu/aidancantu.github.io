My name is Aidan Cantu - I'm a student at The University of Alabama, where I'm studying for a Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering.

This is my personal website, which I use for notes or random posts. Still a work-in-progress but will have more content added over the next few months. Feel free to browse everything here for your own personal use!

Here's what I look like:

## The Website Itself
This site has pages and posts. I will put most of my notes under "pages." I number them, so you should be able to "hop around" the site through the links. My more opininated/one-time articles will be under "posts." These have an [RSS feed](https://aidancantu.com/posts/index.xml).

I made this site using Github Pages and Hugo - very easy to set up for yourself, and an excellent project!
